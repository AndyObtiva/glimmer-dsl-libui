[Glimmer DSL for LibUI](https://rubygems.org/gems/glimmer-dsl-libui) is a dependency-free Ruby desktop development GUI library. No need to pre-install any pre-requisites. Just install the gem and have platform-independent GUI that just works!

[Glimmer DSL for LibUI](https://github.com/AndyObtiva/glimmer-dsl-libui) aims to provide a DSL similar to the [Glimmer DSL for SWT](https://github.com/AndyObtiva/glimmer-dsl-swt) to enable more productive desktop development in Ruby with:
- Declarative DSL syntax that visually maps to the GUI widget hierarchy
- Convention over configuration via smart defaults and automation of low-level details
- Requiring the least amount of syntax possible to build GUI
- Bidirectional Data-Binding to declaratively wire and automatically synchronize GUI with Business Models
- Custom Widget support
- Scaffolding for new custom widgets, apps, and gems
- Native-Executable packaging on Mac, Windows, and Linux

## Contributing to glimmer-dsl-libui

-   Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been
    implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
-   Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't
    requested it and/or contributed it.
-   Fork the project.
-   Start a feature/bugfix branch.
-   Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
-   Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it
    in a future version unintentionally.
-   Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If
    you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that
    is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick
    around it.
